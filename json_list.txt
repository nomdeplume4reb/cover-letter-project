While the scenario of a power failure is firmly anchored in the emergency planning of hospitals, the maintenance of water supply and disposal has hardly been considered so far. Yet it is a prerequisite for the functioning of a hospital and thus for the safety of patients.</p><p>As part of a larger network the particular objective of UNU-EHS\u2019 research is to improve contingency planning for failures or impairments of water supply and sanitation in health care facilities by comprehensively addressing organisational issues. This approach is based on the understanding that successful emergency preparedness can only be achieved through the interaction of technical and organisational processes and that the \u201chuman factor\u201d and social resilience are of elementary importance for strengthening the resilience of health infrastructure.
